## Description

Task 1 Install axios and prettier, scripts
1. Install [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) package as dependency (`npm i axios`) - you can find instruction on website or in [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JrufeLjxbBKKjWqnj1l32hcouQ3Hw-8rMIn_zzCTF7U/edit#slide=id.gef8b43e128_0_14).
2. Install [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) as dev dependency package (`npm i prettier --save-dev`) [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JrufeLjxbBKKjWqnj1l32hcouQ3Hw-8rMIn_zzCTF7U/edit#slide=id.gec017bc9e0_0_0).
3. Create new script in package.json to run prettier for every js file in project. So this command `npm run prettier` has to work and it will fix all your files in project. [Custom scripts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JrufeLjxbBKKjWqnj1l32hcouQ3Hw-8rMIn_zzCTF7U/edit#slide=id.gef8b43e128_0_3) - the command for prettier to format your files is `prettier --write .` So when you run `npm run prettier` it should execute `prettier --write .`
